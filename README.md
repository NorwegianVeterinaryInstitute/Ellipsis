## Plasmid assembly, gene identification and annotation pipeline

Ellipsis will run hybrid assembly and identify the plasmids and chromosomal sequences in these assemblies.
Then, it will identify potential virulence and resistance genes among these sequences, and report them. 

Please see the Wiki for more information.
